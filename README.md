# University_Shuttle_App (Work In Progress)
## About
“University_Shuttle_Ap” is a university project that was assigned to us. The task was to find a problem that students face and make a solution about it so I came up with an idea of making an App that lets students see the Buses, Points and Shuttles that are primary transportaion for students.<br/>
Many times students miss these transporations because they don't know where these are right in the moment around there city.<br/>
Every Driver will have a mobile with location service on and students can see for themselves how to manage their time and location to always get benifit of these facilities
